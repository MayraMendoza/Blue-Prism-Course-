Calc, Data items and multi calc stages 
Calc stage - where you can do calculations 
Outputs will need to be stored. We can store the output in a data item. 
Data item is  a container that stores information. This information can be a number, text or image. (Its very similar to a variable) 
Double click on data item to open data properties. There you will be able to name the data item, select data type and set an initial value. 

Once data type has been created it will appear on the far right under data items (in the appropriate data type category). 
Data items can be used instead of hard coding an expression in calc stage. 

Evaluate Expression- allows you to test the expression with input data. (Its helpful when we have complex data to be evaluated).

Multi Calc stage
Under expressions you can add calculations in order starting from the top.
Example 
Expression:                        Strore in:
[Data1] +[Data2]                 Sum
[Sum]/[Data1]                     Data2

When you have multiple calculations to be done in a sequence, it is always better to use multi calc stage because it is faster.
