Section 1 : Introduction

What is Robotic Process Automation?
-Automation of repeatable and rule based tasks using a software which is installed on a user’s computer called Robot or BOT.
The BOT us Programmed to perform the sequence of steps that human user does.
-The BOT will work exactly like a human user by interacting with the front end of the applications. (Not integrated)

Advantages of RPA 
use existing IT infrastructure without making changes to the current system or databases.
Robot can work 24/7 
Robots can work across multiple platforms like Windows, Web, Java and mainframe applications.
One Robot can be trained to do more than one process at different schedules. 
	(example bot can send interview requests from 9:00 am -12:00pm and other emails after 12:20pm -2:00pm)
Improves efficiency and accuracy 

Limitations of RPA 
The working speed (AHT) of the BOT is limited to the speed of the application 
Tasks that require judgements and creativity cannot be automated 
Even minor changes to the applications will need the Robots to be configured. 
	(example if a button name is changed from “start” to “next” in an application 
	the bot will beed to be reconfigured to select “next”).

Introduction to Blue Prism 
Blue prism is a software that is installed on a users computer and program it to do a sequence of steps to mimic what the user does. 
like launching an application 
Comparing to images and performing optical character recognition 
This is accomplished by creating process flow diagrams in blue prism  that are similar to Visio diagrams where each component in the flowchart is configured to do a specific action.
